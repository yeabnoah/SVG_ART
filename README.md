# SVG File Creation with Pure Code

Welcome to the SVG File Creation project! This repository demonstrates how to create SVG files using pure code, without the need for any editing software.

## Description

When you get bored but donâ€™t want to stop coding or want to stay in the mood, you can write your own SVG file. This project was inspired by a desire to work on editing SVG/PNG files to implement some generic functionality, which led to creating these examples purely through code.

## Features

- Pure code generation of SVG files
- No use of external editing software
- Examples of basic to advanced SVG functionalities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of SVG and coding
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
